## Intro

[Webstudio - next generation visual development](https://dev.to/oleg008/webstudio-next-generation-visual-development-4d0d)

## Examples

[Webstudio landing site](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-landing)

## Designer

   [Webstudio Designer](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-designer) is a NoCode Visual Tool inspired by Webflow. It is the place where you can build your site or app visually.

## SDK

   [Webstudio SDK](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-sdk) is an optional JavaScript/Typescript API that lets you render the same components you see on the canvas in Designer. The Designer is also using this SDK to render on the canvas.

   SDK lets you integrate the site or app you created in Designer into your custom react code base.

### API

   [Webstudio Designer](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-designer) provides a HTTP API you can use to fetch the data from Designer and render it in any way you want.

## CLI

   [Webstudio CLI](https://github.com/webstudio-is/webstudio-cli) is a command-line interface you can use to simplify working with the HTTP API. You can execute a simple script that will fetch the data from a Webstudio Designer instance of your choice and download it onto your local project's file system.

## Roadmap

The roadmap is going to be community-driven, so it's yet TBD. Some initial ideas would be:

1. Quality and feature parity with Webflow's Style Panel and more.
2. Visual Interface for GraphQL bindings creation for integrating with any GraphQL API from services like Shopify or GraphCMS.
3. Accessibility features that help guide users to produce accessible sites.

## Why Are We Building This?

We are building this because we want to make publishing unique software on the web much more accessible. We want to enable millions of people who don't have coding skills to create unique experiences on the web.

We are building this because we are looking forward to a world where you own your data and where publishing on the web is affordable or even free for most cases.

We are building this because we want cross-functional team collaboration between designers, developers, and product owners to become faster. We want to enable non-engineers to do the majority of the changes.
