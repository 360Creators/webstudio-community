# ðŸŒ® AppSumo redemption failed

AppSumo accounts are required to be activated via the AppSumo redemption API (Big yellow "redeem" button from your dashboard). \
\
This activation can fail for several reasons:&#x20;

* Redemption email mismatch between AppSumo and Webstudio
* Closed redemption browser before the account has been activated
* Logged-into wrong account when redeeming the licence (browser will automatically attempt to validate the license on the current logged-in account)
* AppSumo API got confused and hurt itself in confusion

### How to resolve the issue:&#x20;

#### If the AppSumo deal is currently active, the fastest way to resolve this issue is to:&#x20;

* Refund the AppSumo purchase
* Repurchase a new license
* Make sure you're logged-into the correct Webstudio account
* Redeem your purchase again



When/If the AppSumo deal ends and there remains issues with redemption we will update this doc with further instructions.&#x20;
