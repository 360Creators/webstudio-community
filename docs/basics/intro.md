Webstudio is an open-source visual development platform that empowers designers and developers to create responsive web designs with ease. It's a tool designed to bridge the gap between design and code, enabling users to build visually while maintaining control over the underlying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 🧑‍🎨 For Designers

Webstudio offers a powerful platform to bring their creative visions to life without the need for extensive coding knowledge. It provides an intuitive visual interface where they can construct layouts, style components, and animate elements in real-time on a live canvas. This direct manipulation of design elements allows for immediate feedback and faster iteration cycles.&#x20;

### 🧑‍💻 For Developers

Developers will find value in Webstudio's flexibility and extensibility. While it simplifies many aspects of web development through its visual interface, it does not abstract away from the underlying code entirely. Developers can dive into custom code and create unique components with complex logic or specific integrations - providing them with all the power and versatility that coding affords while still benefiting from Webstudio's streamlined visual workflows. Being open-source also means developers have freedom to extend functionality based on project needs or contribute back to improve upon existing features.
