# ðŸ”— Roadmap & Links

## What is the team working on?

Despite being a small team, we're incredibly agile and committed to delivering a steady stream of fresh and exciting features to our users. We operate on a fortnightly release cycle for substantial feature updates, ensuring that Webstudio is always evolving and improving.

Transparency is one of our core values, and we believe in sharing our development journey with our community. Follow along with the design, development, marketing, and operations behind the scenes at Webstudio.

Here you will find real-time updates and can see exactly what our team is working on, how far we've come, and what's coming up next. This open-door approach is part of our commitment to building a product that is as much a vision of our community as it is of our team.
