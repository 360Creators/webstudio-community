<summary>üåê What is open source?</summary>

Open source software stems from the free software movement, emphasizing freedom in software usage, modification, and distribution. While terms like _open source_, _free_, _libre_, and _open core_ have subtle differences, they share many principles. Key differentiators include licensing terms and the level of permissiveness.

The Open Source Initiative defines criteria for open source software, including free redistribution, access to source code, and allowance for modified/derived works. Licenses must not discriminate against any groups or use cases and must permit bundling with other software.

Some products blend open source and proprietary components, leading to the "open core" label, where the core functionality is open source but excludes proprietary parts. A well-known example is Android's use on Pixel phones: powered by the open source Android Open Source Project (AOSP), yet the phone's software remains proprietary.

<summary>üåç What is Cloudflare Workers edge deployment, and how does it work?</summary>

Cloudflare Workers are like small programs that run on Cloudflare's global network of servers. They allow you to customize and control how your website or application behaves, all without needing to manage your own server infrastructure. This global and distributed nature means that your code executes closer to your users, resulting in faster response times and improved reliability, regardless of where your users are located around the world. Plus, you can easily scale your application without worrying about provisioning or managing servers in different regions.

<summary>üé® What are design tokens?</summary>

Design Tokens provide a unified system for managing styles like colors, spacing, and font sizes. They serve as a single source of truth for both designers and developers, housed in accessible formats like JSON files. This system ensures consistency across a project and simplifies design maintenance.

A common application of design tokens is in semantic color naming, where names correspond to usage rather than color values. The flexibility of design tokens allows for referencing, condition-specific alterations, and mathematical manipulations.

<summary>üñºÔ∏è How does Webstudio optimize images?</summary>

Images significantly impact web page sizes and loading times. Google's WebP format, supporting both lossless and lossy compression, alpha channels, and animation, helps reduce image sizes by about 30% compared to traditional formats.

Webstudio automatically converts images to WebP and resizes them to fit webpage dimensions, ensuring optimal sizes without compromising quality.
