Welcome to Webstudio
{% endembed %}

In this video overview we cover the basics in getting started with your first video project.&#x20;

### Signup to Webstudio&#x20;

1. Visit [https://webstudio.is/](https://webstudio.is/) and click on the "start building" or "sign in" button.&#x20;
2. Create an account with either Google or Github \


### Create a new project or import a template

Once logged-in, you will be presented with your dashboard. From here you'll see an overview of existing project and the option to create a new blank project or start with a premade template. \


### Understand the builder Interface

The first step in using any new tool effectively is understanding its interface. Familiarize yourself with Webstudio's builder - this is where your website will come to life. The Components panel houses all available elements like text, images, links and more which you can drag onto your canvas. For an in-depth guide on the [anatomy of the Webstudio builder, read our intro here](../university/foundations/anatomy-of-the-webstudio-builder.md).\


### Use Design Tokens

Instead of traditional classes, Webstudio uses Design Tokens for styling consistency across different platforms. These tokens are reusable styles that eliminate naming conflicts and external dependencies issues common in large projects using CSS classes. [Learn more about Design Tokens as they form an integral part of designing on WebStudio.](../university/foundations/design-tokens.md)\


### Experiment With Components

Components are building blocks for your website â€“ from basic ones like Text and Image to advanced components such as HTML Embeds or Radix components. Drag them onto your canvas and start experimenting! You can customize each componentâ€™s properties under "Settings."\


### Preview & Publish

Once satisfied with what you've built, preview it using the 'Preview' button at top right corner before publishing it live on the internet! [We have an in-depth publishing guide here](../university/foundations/publishing-and-custom-domains.md).&#x20;
