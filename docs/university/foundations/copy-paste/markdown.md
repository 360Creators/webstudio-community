# ↔️ Markdown

Copy Markdown and paste it into Webstudio, and it will automatically add all the components, such as headings, images, and links.

{% hint style="info" %}
Many tools use Markdown behind the scenes, letting you copy directly from the editor.
{% endhint %}

Example sources:

* Markdown
* Notion
* SurferSEO
* Obsidian
* Coda

Want to embed Markdown? See [Markdown Embed](../../core-components/markdown-embed.md).\
