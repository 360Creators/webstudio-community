# üì§ Self-Hosting

{% hint style="info" %}
The Webstudio Builder can also be self-hosted, but at this time, it‚Äôs only for advanced users and is intended to be run locally. See the [hosting the Builder documentation](../../contributing/contributing-for-developers.md) for more information.
{% endhint %}

## Exporting

There are two ways to export Projects:

1. [**Webstudio CLI** ](cli.md)‚Äì Allows you to interact with and export your Projects. **Supports** [**SSR**](./#server-side-rendering-ssr) **and** [**SSG**](./#static-site-generator-ssg) **(see below).**
2. [**Download button in the Builder**](download.md) ‚Äì Click a button in the Webstudio Builder, and the Project will be downloaded as a zip. **Supports** [**SSG**](./#ssg-limitations) **(see below).**&#x20;

## Export rendering options

There are two rendering options when exporting Projects:

* **Server-side rendering (SSR)** ‚Äì Outputs a dynamic [Remix app](https://remix.run/). This is the default behavior of Webstudio Cloud and provides the most functionality, but it requires hosting that works with apps.
* **Static site generator (SSG)** ‚Äì Outputs a static site (HTML/CSS/JS) with limited functionality, but has more versatile hosting options.

### Server-side rendering (SSR)

This is the default behavior if you were to publish to Webstudio Cloud.

SSR supports dynamic functionality like [CMS integrations](../foundations/cms.md), Webhook forms, [image optimization](../core-components/image.md#optimize), redirects, and more.

Dynamic apps can‚Äôt be deployed to ‚Äútraditional‚Äù hosting platforms such as Hostinger, DreamHost, or SiteGround as the app is more than static files that need to be served. Instead, it requires an environment to handle server-side code execution, fetching data from CMS integrations, and more.

#### Platforms (SSR)

Here are the platforms we have documented:

{% content-ref url="netlify-2.md" %}
[netlify-2.md](netlify-2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="vercel.md" %}
[vercel.md](vercel.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### **Static site generator (SSG)**

You can optionally export your Webstudio Project as a static site, i.e., a collection of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. This allows you to host your site on traditional hosting providers or, better yet, on dedicated static site hosting and deployment platforms.

#### SSG limitations

While SSG exporting and hosting are less technical, this comes at the cost of functionality.

**The following are **_**not**_** supported:**

* Dynamic pages
* Redirects
* Statuses
* Client navigation
* Webhook form
* Image optimization
* No robots.txt
* No sitemap.xml

#### Platforms (SSG)

Here are the platforms we have documented:

{% content-ref url="netlify.md" %}
[netlify.md](netlify.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="netlify-1.md" %}
[netlify-1.md](netlify-1.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="netlify-2.md" %}
[netlify-2.md](netlify-2.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="vercel.md" %}
[vercel.md](vercel.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
