# ▶️ Cloudflare Pages

[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is a powerful platform for deploying your projects. It’s simple to use, has a generous free tier, and leverages the Cloudflare Network, offering speed, security, and reliability.

While Cloudflare Pages supports static sites and dynamic apps, only the Webstudio static export is currently compatible.
