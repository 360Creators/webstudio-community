# ðŸ“¤ Self-Hosting & CLI

Webstudio's Command Line Interface (CLI) is a robust tool that provides everyone with the ability to interact directly with their projects from the command line.&#x20;

One of the key features of Webstudio's CLI is its exporting capability. With this, you can export your entire Webstudio project in full.&#x20;

Once exported, these projects are ready to be deployed on any hosting platform of your choice - giving you complete freedom over where and how your website goes live.&#x20;

To assist users through this process, we have comprehensive guides available detailing each step involved in exporting and self-hosting your projects. These guides provide clear instructions along with helpful tips to ensure a smooth transition from design to deployment.
