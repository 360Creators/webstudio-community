How to Export and Self-Host Your Site on Vercel
{% endembed %}

Vercel, a popular cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions, is known for its ease of use and performance optimization capabilities. It provides an ideal environment for deploying your Webstudio projects.

With the help of Webstudio's CLI, exporting your project and preparing it for deployment on Vercel becomes a streamlined process. The exported code can be pushed directly to a repository on GitHub or GitLab, which can then be connected with Vercel for continuous deployment.

This means any changes made in your project within Webstudio can be easily updated on the live site hosted by Vercel - ensuring that your website remains up-to-date with all the latest modifications done during development.
